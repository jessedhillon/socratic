### **Topic: Ratios and Proportional Reasoning (Intro Week)**

### **Weekly Objective**

Students understand what a ratio represents, can distinguish ratios from absolute quantities, and can reason about proportional relationships verbally and numerically.

This is an excellent fit: conceptual misunderstandings are common and easily masked by procedural competence.

### **Assessment Prompts (AI-led discussion)**

1. _“In your own words, what is a ratio?”_
2. _“How is a ratio different from a fraction? Are they ever the same?”_
3. _“If a recipe uses 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of water, what stays the same if we double the recipe?”_
4. _“Give an example of two quantities that **cannot** form a meaningful ratio. Explain why.”_
5. _(Challenge)_ _“If two ratios are equal, must the quantities involved be the same size? Why or why not?”_

### **Rubric (Conceptual, not procedural)**

**Mastery**

- Defines ratio as a _relationship between quantities_, not just “a fraction.”
- Correctly explains invariance under scaling.
- Distinguishes ratio equality from quantity equality.
- Identifies invalid ratios (e.g., mismatched units) with justification.

**Partial Mastery**

- Uses correct language but relies on examples without abstraction.
- Confuses ratio with fraction but self-corrects when challenged.
- Understands scaling but not invariance explicitly.

**Insufficient**

- Defines ratio as “division” only.
- Cannot explain what stays the same when scaling.
- Treats ratios as static numbers divorced from meaning.

**Red Flag (Illusory Mastery)**

- Fluent explanations with no ability to handle counterexamples.
- Repeats vocabulary (“proportional,” “equivalent”) without reasoning.
