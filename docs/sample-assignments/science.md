### **Topic: The Particle Nature of Matter**

### **Weekly Objective**

Students understand that matter is made of particles too small to see, that particles are in motion, and that particle motion explains observable phenomena like diffusion and expansion.

This is where verbal probing is _far superior_ to worksheets.

### **Assessment Prompts**

1. _“What does it mean to say that matter is made of particles?”_
2. _“If particles are invisible, how do we know they exist?”_
3. _“Why does perfume spread across a room even without wind?”_
4. _“What changes—and what doesn’t—when a solid melts into a liquid?”_
5. _(Challenge)_ _“Does heating matter create new particles? Explain.”_

### **Rubric**

**Mastery**

- Explains particles as explanatory models, not objects of belief.
- Correctly links particle motion to diffusion.
- Distinguishes physical change from creation/destruction of matter.
- Uses consistent reasoning across states of matter.

**Partial Mastery**

- Understands particles exist but treats them vaguely.
- Explains diffusion descriptively (“it spreads”) without mechanism.
- Confuses heat with matter but can recover when prompted.

**Insufficient**

- Treats particles as metaphorical.
- Attributes diffusion to air “carrying” substances only.
- Thinks melting changes what something _is_, not how particles move.

**Red Flag**

- Memorized phrases (“particles move faster”) without causal explanation.
