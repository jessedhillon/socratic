### **Topic: Theme vs. Plot in Narrative Texts**

### **Weekly Objective**

Students can distinguish what happens in a story from what the story is _about_, and can articulate themes without reducing them to morals.

This is one of the strongest LLM use cases.

### **Assessment Prompts**

1. _“What is the difference between plot and theme?”_
2. _“Can two stories with very different plots share the same theme?”_
3. _“What might be a theme of a story where a character fails at their goal?”_
4. _“Why is ‘don’t lie’ usually not a good way to describe a theme?”_
5. _(Challenge)_ _“Can a story have more than one theme? How would we know?”_
