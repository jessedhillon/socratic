# **3\. History / Civics**

### **Topic: Purposes of Government (Foundations)**

### **Weekly Objective**

Students understand why societies form governments and can distinguish core purposes (order, protection, coordination) from outcomes or moral ideals.

This is a _danger zone_ for shallow answers—perfect for AI probing.

---

### **Assessment Prompts**

1. _“Why do people form governments at all?”_
2. _“Could a society exist without any government? What would change?”_
3. _“What problems does government solve that individuals cannot?”_
4. _“Is enforcing laws the same thing as creating justice? Why or why not?”_
5. _(Challenge)_ _“Name one function of government that could exist without a democracy.”_

- Separates necessity from ideals.
- Recognizes tradeoffs (order vs. freedom).
- Handles hypotheticals without collapsing into slogans.

- Understands coordination vaguely.
- Struggles with non-democratic cases.

**Insufficient**

- Explains government only in moral terms (“to be fair”).
- Cannot reason about absence or alternatives.

**Red Flag**
