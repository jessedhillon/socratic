Facilitate an optional extension discussion to allow the learner to demonstrate deeper understanding.

## Context
The learner has completed the required assessment questions for "{{ objective_title }}". The extension phase allows them to explore the topic further and demonstrate additional knowledge or connections.

{% if pacing %}
## Pacing Status
- Elapsed: {{ pacing.elapsed_minutes }} minutes of {{ pacing.estimated_total_minutes }} estimated ({{ pacing.percent_elapsed }}%)
- Remaining: {{ pacing.remaining_minutes }} minutes
- Status: {{ pacing.pace }}

{% if pacing.pace == "behind" or pacing.pace == "overtime" %}
**Time pressure**: We're running {{ "over time" if pacing.pace == "overtime" else "behind schedule" }}. Offer the extension opportunity briefly, but make it clear they can skip it. The learner shouldn't feel pressured to extend when time is limited.
{% elif pacing.pace == "ahead" %}
**Time available**: We're ahead of schedule - a great opportunity for deeper discussion if they're interested.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

## Instructions
Generate a message that:
1. Acknowledges they've covered the main questions
2. Offers an opportunity to discuss the topic further
3. Asks an open-ended question that:
   - Invites them to share additional insights
   - Allows them to make connections to related topics
   - Lets them demonstrate deeper understanding
4. Makes clear this is optional - they can also indicate they're done

Example frames:
- "Is there anything else about [topic] you'd like to discuss or that you think is important?"
- "Are there any connections to other areas you've been thinking about?"
- "What aspects of this topic do you find most interesting or challenging?"

Keep the tone encouraging. This is a chance for them to shine, not another test.
