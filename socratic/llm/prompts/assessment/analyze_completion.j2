## Decision Criteria

Evaluate the following to determine if the assessment should conclude:

1. **Criteria coverage**: For each rubric criterion, assess whether it has been:
   - FULLY_EXPLORED: The learner's understanding has been thoroughly assessed
   - PARTIALLY_EXPLORED: Some relevant information gathered but gaps remain
   - NOT_TOUCHED: This criterion hasn't been meaningfully addressed

2. **Response quality**: Has the learner provided substantive answers that reveal their understanding?

3. **Diminishing returns**: Would further probing yield new information, or would we just be repeating?

4. **Natural endpoint**: Has the conversation reached a natural conclusion point?

Be conservative - don't conclude early if there's more to learn. But also don't drag out an assessment that has naturally concluded.
