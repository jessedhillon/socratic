Analyze whether the assessment should now conclude or continue.

## Objective
{{ objective_title }}

## Assessment Criteria
{% for criterion in rubric_criteria %}
### {{ criterion.name }}
{{ criterion.description }}
- Evidence indicators: {{ criterion.evidence_indicators | join(", ") }}
{% endfor %}

## Conversation Summary
{{ conversation_summary }}

## Progress
- Questions completed: {{ prompts_completed }} of {{ total_prompts }}
- Follow-up probes used: {{ probing_depth }}

## Instructions
Analyze the conversation and determine if the assessment should conclude.

Consider:
1. **Criteria coverage**: Have all rubric criteria been meaningfully explored?
2. **Response quality**: Has the learner provided substantive answers that reveal their understanding?
3. **Diminishing returns**: Would further probing yield new information, or are we just repeating?
4. **Natural endpoint**: Has the conversation reached a natural conclusion point?

Respond with a structured assessment in this exact format:

COMPLETION_READY: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW]
CRITERIA_STATUS:
{% for criterion in rubric_criteria %}
- {{ criterion.name }}: [FULLY_EXPLORED, PARTIALLY_EXPLORED, or NOT_TOUCHED]
{% endfor %}
REASONING: [Brief explanation of your decision]
SUMMARY: [If completion ready, a 2-3 sentence summary of what was assessed]

Be conservative - don't conclude early if there's more to learn. But also don't drag out an assessment that has naturally concluded.
