## Objective
{{ objective_title }}

## Summary of Discussion
{{ conversation_summary }}

## Instructions
Generate a closing message that:

1. Thanks the learner for their time and thoughtful responses

2. Provides a brief summary of the key points they made, including:
   - Main ideas they expressed
   - Examples or explanations they provided
   - Any interesting connections they drew

3. **CRITICAL**: Asks if you understood them correctly
   - This is a guardrail against AI misinterpretation
   - Give them explicit opportunity to correct or clarify
   - Example: "Did I understand you correctly? Is there anything you'd like to clarify or add?"

4. Explains what happens next (their responses will be reviewed)

5. Ends on an encouraging note

## Important
- Do NOT reveal how they did or provide any evaluation
- Do NOT hint at whether their answers were right or wrong
- The summary should reflect THEIR words and ideas, not yours
- Be accurate - don't put words in their mouth
