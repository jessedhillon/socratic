Generate a closing message that summarizes the discussion and allows the learner to correct any misunderstandings.

## Objective
{{ objective_title }}

## Summary of Discussion
{{ conversation_summary }}

{% if criteria_coverage %}
## Criteria Coverage (internal reference)
{% for criterion_id, coverage in criteria_coverage.items() %}
- {{ coverage.criterion_name }}: {{ coverage.coverage_level }}
  {% if coverage.evidence_found %}- Evidence gathered: {{ coverage.evidence_found | join("; ") }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% set fully_explored = criteria_coverage.values() | selectattr("coverage_level", "eq", "fully_explored") | list %}
{% set partial = criteria_coverage.values() | selectattr("coverage_level", "eq", "partially_explored") | list %}
{% set unexplored = criteria_coverage.values() | selectattr("coverage_level", "eq", "not_started") | list %}

**Coverage summary**: {{ fully_explored | length }} fully explored, {{ partial | length }} partially explored, {{ unexplored | length }} not explored
{% endif %}

## Instructions
Generate a closing message that:

1. Thanks the learner for their time and thoughtful responses

2. Provides a brief summary of the key points they made, including:
   - Main ideas they expressed
   - Examples or explanations they provided
   - Any interesting connections they drew

3. **CRITICAL**: Asks if you understood them correctly
   - This is a guardrail against AI misinterpretation
   - Give them explicit opportunity to correct or clarify
   - Example: "Did I understand you correctly? Is there anything you'd like to clarify or add?"

4. Explains what happens next (their responses will be reviewed)

5. Ends on an encouraging note

## Important
- Do NOT reveal how they did or provide any evaluation
- Do NOT hint at whether their answers were right or wrong
- Do NOT mention the criteria coverage status to the learner
- The summary should reflect THEIR words and ideas, not yours
- Be accurate - don't put words in their mouth
