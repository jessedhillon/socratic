Generate an orientation message to welcome the learner and explain the assessment format.

The message should:
1. Greet the learner warmly
2. Explain this is a conversation about "{{ objective_title }}"
3. Mention the expected duration (~{{ time_expectation_minutes or 15 }} minutes)
4. Reassure them:
   - There are no trick questions
   - They should think through their responses
   - It's okay to say "I don't know" or ask for clarification
   - You may ask follow-up questions to understand their thinking
5. Ask if they're ready to begin

Keep the tone friendly and encouraging. The goal is to put the learner at ease before the assessment begins.
