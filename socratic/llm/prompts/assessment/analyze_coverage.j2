Analyze the learner's response to determine which rubric criteria were addressed.

## Learner's Response
{{ learner_response }}

## Recent Conversation Context
{% for message in conversation_history %}
- {{ message }}
{% endfor %}

## Rubric Criteria to Assess
{% for criterion in rubric_criteria %}
### {{ criterion.name }} (ID: {{ criterion.criterion_id }})
{{ criterion.description }}
- Evidence indicators: {{ criterion.evidence_indicators | join(", ") if criterion.evidence_indicators else "Not specified" }}
{% endfor %}

## Current Coverage Status
{% for criterion_id, coverage in criteria_coverage.items() %}
- {{ coverage.criterion_name }}: {{ coverage.coverage_level }}
  {% if coverage.evidence_found %}- Evidence so far: {{ coverage.evidence_found | join("; ") }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Analysis Required
For each criterion, determine if the learner's response provides evidence related to it.

Respond in the following format:
CRITERIA_COVERAGE:
{% for criterion in rubric_criteria %}
- {{ criterion.criterion_id }}: [none/partial/full] - "[brief evidence quote or 'no evidence']"
{% endfor %}

Guidelines:
- "none": No evidence related to this criterion in the response
- "partial": Some relevant information but incomplete or needs clarification
- "full": Clear, substantive evidence addressing this criterion

Be specific about what evidence you found. Quote the learner's words when possible.
