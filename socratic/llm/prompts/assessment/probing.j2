Generate a follow-up question to probe deeper into the learner's understanding.

## Issue Detected
{% if detected_ambiguity %}
- **Ambiguity**: The learner's response was unclear{% if ambiguous_phrase %}, specifically: "{{ ambiguous_phrase }}"{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if detected_inconsistency %}
- **Inconsistency**: The learner said something that contradicts an earlier statement
  {% if earlier_point %}- Earlier they said: "{{ earlier_point }}"{% endif %}
  {% if current_point %}- Now they said: "{{ current_point }}"{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if detected_evasion %}
- **Evasion**: The learner appears to be avoiding the question directly
{% endif %}

## Probing Depth
This is follow-up #{{ probing_depth + 1 }}. Be proportionally more direct if this is a repeated follow-up.

{% if challenge_prompts %}
## Available Challenge Prompts (use if appropriate)
{% for prompt in challenge_prompts %}
- {{ prompt }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Instructions
Generate a single follow-up question that:
{% if detected_ambiguity %}
- Asks them to clarify what they meant
- Uses their own words to show you're listening
- Example frame: "When you say X, what do you mean by that?"
{% elif detected_inconsistency %}
- Gently points out the apparent contradiction
- Asks them to help you understand how both statements fit together
- Avoid accusatory language - be curious, not challenging
- Example frame: "Earlier you mentioned X, but just now you said Y. Can you help me understand how these connect?"
{% elif detected_evasion %}
- Asks for a specific example or concrete case
- Brings them back to the core question
- Example frame: "Can you give me a specific example of what that would look like?"
{% else %}
- Explores their reasoning more deeply
- Asks "how" or "why" rather than "what"
{% endif %}

Keep the question focused and natural. Do not ask multiple questions at once.
