Analyze the learner's response for quality signals. This is an internal analysis - do NOT generate a message for the learner.

## Learner's Response
{{ learner_response }}

## Recent Conversation Context
{% for message in conversation_history %}
- {{ message }}
{% endfor %}

## Rubric Criteria to Consider
{% for criterion in rubric_criteria %}
### {{ criterion.name }}
{{ criterion.description }}

Proficiency levels (use these to gauge quality of response):
{% for level in criterion.proficiency_levels %}
- **{{ level.grade }}**: {{ level.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

## Analysis Required
Evaluate the response for the following issues:

1. **AMBIGUOUS**: Is the response unclear or vague?
   - Did they use imprecise language that could mean multiple things?
   - Did they avoid specifics when specifics were needed?
   - If yes, identify the ambiguous phrase.

2. **INCONSISTENT**: Does the response contradict something they said earlier?
   - Did they make a claim that conflicts with a previous statement?
   - If yes, identify both the earlier point and the current point.

3. **EVASION**: Did they avoid answering the question directly?
   - Did they change the subject?
   - Did they give a generic answer that doesn't address the specific question?
   - Did they demonstrate high fluency but low substance?

Respond with your analysis in the following format:
- AMBIGUOUS: [yes/no] - "[ambiguous phrase if yes]"
- INCONSISTENT: [yes/no] - Earlier: "[earlier point]" Now: "[current point]"
- EVASION: [yes/no] - "[description if yes]"

Keep the analysis brief and factual.
