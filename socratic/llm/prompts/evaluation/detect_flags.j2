You are analyzing an assessment transcript for potential red flags that may require educator review.

## Learning Objective
**{{ objective_title }}**

## Full Transcript
{% for segment in transcript_segments %}
[{{ segment.utterance_type }}]: {{ segment.content }}
{% endfor %}

## Evidence Summary
{% for mapping in evidence_mappings %}
- **{{ mapping.criterion_name }}**: {{ mapping.strength }} evidence
  {% if mapping.failure_modes_detected %}- Failure modes: {{ mapping.failure_modes_detected | join(", ") }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Flags to Check

1. **HighFluencyLowSubstance**: The learner speaks eloquently but provides little actual evidence of understanding. Look for:
   - Long, well-structured responses with vague or generic content
   - Use of appropriate vocabulary without demonstrating comprehension
   - Confident delivery but inability to provide specific examples

2. **RepeatedEvasion**: The learner consistently avoids engaging with questions. Look for:
   - Topic changes when asked direct questions
   - Providing tangential information instead of direct answers
   - Multiple instances of "I'm not sure" without attempting to reason through

3. **VocabularyMirroring**: The learner parrots terminology without explanation. Look for:
   - Using terms from the questions without elaboration
   - Repeating interviewer language verbatim
   - Inability to explain terms in their own words

4. **InconsistentReasoning**: The learner contradicts themselves. Look for:
   - Statements that conflict with earlier responses
   - Logic that doesn't follow from premises
   - Changing positions without acknowledgment

5. **PossibleGaming**: The learner may be trying to game the assessment. Look for:
   - Responses that seem rehearsed or scripted
   - Overly specific answers that don't match natural conversation
   - Attempts to probe for expected answers before responding

## Your Task
Analyze the transcript for each flag type. Be conservative - only flag issues that are clearly present.

Respond in JSON format ONLY (no markdown code blocks):
{
  "flags": [
    {
      "flag_type": "flag name from list above",
      "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
      "evidence": "specific example from transcript",
      "reasoning": "brief explanation"
    }
  ],
  "overall_assessment": "brief summary of any concerns"
}

If no flags are detected, return:
{
  "flags": [],
  "overall_assessment": "No significant concerns detected"
}
