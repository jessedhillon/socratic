You are grading a learner's performance on a specific rubric criterion based on extracted evidence.

## Criterion
**{{ criterion.name }}**: {{ criterion.description }}

## Grade Thresholds
{% for threshold in criterion.grade_thresholds %}
- **{{ threshold.grade }}**: {{ threshold.description }}
  {% if threshold.min_evidence_count %}(Requires at least {{ threshold.min_evidence_count }} pieces of evidence){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Extracted Evidence
Evidence present: {{ evidence.evidence_present }}
Strength: {{ evidence.strength }}

### Supporting Quotes
{% for quote in evidence.quotes %}
- "{{ quote }}"
{% endfor %}

### Failure Modes Detected
{% if evidence.failure_modes_detected %}
{% for mode in evidence.failure_modes_detected %}
- {{ mode }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
None detected
{% endif %}

### Evaluator Notes
{{ evidence.reasoning }}

## Your Task
Based on the evidence above and the grade thresholds, assign a grade for this criterion.

Consider:
1. The quantity and quality of evidence
2. Any failure modes that were detected
3. The strength assessment from evidence extraction

Respond in JSON format ONLY (no markdown code blocks):
{
  "grade": "S" or "A" or "C" or "F",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation for this grade"
}
