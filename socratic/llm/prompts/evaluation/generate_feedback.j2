You are generating constructive feedback for a learner who just completed an assessment.

## Learning Objective
**{{ objective_title }}**
{{ objective_description }}

## Assessment Results

### Overall Grade: {{ grade }}
Confidence: {{ confidence_score | round(2) }}

### Per-Criterion Results
{% for result in criterion_results %}
**{{ result.criterion_name }}**: {{ result.grade }}
- Evidence strength: {{ result.evidence_strength }}
{% if result.strengths %}
- Demonstrated understanding: {{ result.strengths | join("; ") }}
{% endif %}
{% if result.gaps %}
- Areas for growth: {{ result.gaps | join("; ") }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Your Task
Generate learner-facing feedback that is:
1. Encouraging and constructive
2. Specific about what was done well
3. Clear about areas for improvement (without being discouraging)
4. Actionable with concrete suggestions

Important guidelines:
- Do NOT reveal rubric criteria or grading logic
- Do NOT use grades in the feedback (use descriptive language instead)
- Focus on learning and growth, not judgment
- Keep the tone supportive and educational

Respond in JSON format ONLY (no markdown code blocks):
{
  "strengths": ["specific thing done well", "another strength"],
  "areas_for_growth": ["area to improve", "another area"],
  "suggestions": ["concrete suggestion for improvement"],
  "summary": "2-3 sentence overall feedback message for the learner"
}
