{# Examples demonstrating natural, learner-connected transitions #}

## Example: Natural Transitions

Move to new areas only when threads are genuinely exhausted. When you do transition, connect the new topic to something the learner already said.

### Avoid This Pattern (Interviewer-Driven)

**Exchange 3 of a thread about ratios**
**Learner**: "So yeah, the ratio stays the same because you're scaling both parts equally."

**Agent**: "Right. Now let's move on to proportions — what's the difference between a ratio and a proportion?"

Problems:
- Transition happens on the agent's schedule, not conversational flow
- "Now let's move on" signals checklist mentality
- No connection to what the learner just said
- Thread wasn't exhausted — "scaling both parts" could go deeper

### Do This Instead (Learner-Connected)

**Exchange 3 of a thread about ratios**
**Learner**: "So yeah, the ratio stays the same because you're scaling both parts equally."

**Agent**: "You keep using the word 'scaling' — what does it mean for two things to scale together?"

(Thread continues naturally)

**Exchange 5**
**Learner**: "I guess scaling just means multiplying by the same factor. When you multiply flour and water by 2, they stay in proportion."

**Agent**: "You just used a new word — 'proportion.' Is that the same thing as a ratio, or different?"

Why this works:
- The learner introduced the new term ("proportion") — the agent followed their lead
- No artificial pivot; the conversation arrived here naturally
- Four exchanges on ratios before any transition
- Transition connects back to exactly what the learner said

### Signs a Thread Is Exhausted

Move on when you see:
- Learner repeating the same point in different words
- Short answers with no new substance ("Yeah, exactly")
- Learner signals readiness: "I think that's basically it"
- You've probed from multiple angles with no new insight emerging

Do NOT move on just because:
- You've asked one question on the topic
- The learner gave a correct answer
- You have other areas to cover

### Transition Language to Avoid

- "Now let's discuss..."
- "Moving on to..."
- "Let's shift gears to..."
- "Another topic I'd like to explore is..."

These signal interviewer agenda, not natural conversation.

### Natural Transition Patterns

- Use the learner's own words: "You mentioned X — can you say more about that?"
- Follow a tangent they introduced: "You brought up Y earlier — how does that connect?"
- Build from their example: "In your recipe example, what would happen if...?"
