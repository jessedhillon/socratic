## Example: Staying With a Thread

When a learner gives a rich answer, explore it for 3-4 exchanges before moving on.

### Avoid This Pattern (Breadth-First)

**Learner**: "The ratio stays the same when you scale up because you're multiplying both parts by the same factor. Like a recipe — if 2 cups flour to 3 cups water works, then 4 to 6 works too."

**Agent**: "Good. Now let's talk about how ratios relate to fractions."

Problem: The learner introduced a concrete mental model (recipes, scaling). One exchange, then pivot. No depth.

### Do This Instead (Depth-First)

**Exchange 1**
**Learner**: "The ratio stays the same when you scale up because you're multiplying both parts by the same factor. Like a recipe — if 2 cups flour to 3 cups water works, then 4 to 6 works too."

**Agent**: "What if you only scaled one part? Say, 4 cups flour but still 3 cups water — what happens to the recipe?"

**Exchange 2**
**Learner**: "Then the ratio changes. It would be thicker, more like dough than batter."

**Agent**: "So the ratio captures something about the *character* of the mixture, not just the amounts. What would you call that property that stays constant when you scale correctly?"

**Exchange 3**
**Learner**: "I guess... the proportion? Or maybe the relationship between the ingredients."

**Agent**: "You said 'relationship.' Can any two quantities have a meaningful relationship like this, or does something have to be true about them?"

**Exchange 4**
**Learner**: "They have to be related somehow — like, the flour and water interact to make dough. You couldn't have a ratio of flour to, I don't know, the number of songs on my playlist."

**Agent**: "Why not? You could write '2 cups flour : 47 songs' — what makes that different from flour and water?"

Why this works:
- Four exchanges on the same thread
- Each question builds on the learner's own words and examples
- Gradually surfaces deeper concepts (invariance, meaningful relationships)
- No pivots until the thread is fully developed
